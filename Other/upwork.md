## 怎么写Proposal

```
Hi, My name's XXX and I'm very interested in this project, especially as I'm a children's book illustration specialist :) I can also create in a traditional freehand style, or a digital style (check out the attached designs to see examples of my work)
```

第一段很正常，说明了对我项目的兴趣和自己的背景。

```
I can also complete your 10 images for your $284 fixed budget. It's a little lower than I'd normally charge but I love love love creating illustrations for books :) Plus this one sounds like it's going to be a cool and adventurous one :D
```
因为对我项目的兴趣主动让步降价，非常感人，我顿时动心了。

```
As for turnaround, I can start from today and I estimate completion in around 3 weeks.
If you have any questions for me then feel free to ask.
Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you and hopefully working together to complete your awesome book illustrations.
Kind regards

```

表示马上就可以开工，非常诚恳。


还有别的，例如：

```
If you need to see some more, please send me a message. I may do a free sample of whatever you would like to see and send within 24 hours.
```

因为画画这种事情和风格什么的有很大关系，所以主动提供样稿显得很有诚意。

```
I’ve carefully gone through your job posting and I am very much interested in working on your project. I always strive to guarantee my clients 100% satisfaction and I'll be happy to complete this project with UNLIMITED revisions till you get 100% satisfaction.
```

仅仅是一句“我很认真的看了你的post并且很感兴趣”真的可以把好感提升一个度，尽管我猜这是套路。另外，无限次的修改也很有吸引力。

还有狠一点的：

```
I know you’ll probably get a bunch of lowball bids but do you really want to risk this project with somebody unskilled?
```
